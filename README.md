This is a project purely for use teaching people about using git, with github as the repository hosting service.

As its used that way, there should be regular activity against it.  Lots of forking, commits, reverts, merges, etc.

Sound and fury, signifying nothing.

##What to do

1. fork the repository (there is a button, eponymously named)
2. make a new file (there is a button, symbolically appropriate)
3. add some your favorite flavor of `lorem ipsum` to that file.
4. add some more, more, and more.
5. look at the commit history (again, sensibly labelled via the web interface)
6. make a branch
7. add some stuff in that branch (see steps 2-4)
8. switch back to original branch

fixing thing 1!
